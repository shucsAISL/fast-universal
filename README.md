# fast-universal

This repository contains the source code for the optimized algorithm of [1] to speed up the generation of universal adversarial perturbation.

tensorflow-gpu:`tensorflow-gpu 1.1.0`

get started:`python demo_DenseNet121.py`

You can also compute a universal adversarial perturbation for your model by following the struture in `demo_DenseNet121.py`
